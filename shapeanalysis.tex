Pointers and heap-allocated storage are features of all modern imperative programming languages.
They are among the most
complicated features of imperative programming language:
updating pointer variables (or pointer-fields of records) may have large side effects.
For example, dereferencing a pointer that has been freed will lead to segmentation fault in a C or C++ program.
Such side effects also make program analysis harder, because they make it
difficult to compute aliasing relationships among different pointers in a program. Aliasing arises when the same memory location can be accessed using different names.
For instance, consider the instruction statement $\tt x.f := y$ in an imperative language, where $\tt x$ and $\tt y$ are pointer variables. Its effect is to assign the value of the pointer $\tt y$ to the cell pointed to by $\tt x.f$. In order to update aliasing information of $\tt y$. We have to require information about all the cell pointed by $\tt x.f$ which is not an easy task.
%\bjcom{The last two sentences do not make sense (e.g., x.f points to exactly one
%  cell, so what means ``all cells''?). Make a new try}

In verification and program analysis, it is a problem to deduce and describe  how the heap-allocated memory is organized. E.g., program invariants must often describe how the heap-allocated memory is structured in order to infer the effects of statements that dereference pointer fields. This is the topic of ``shape analysis''.


%\bjcom{First sentence must be rewritten}
Shape analysis is a generic term denoting static
program-analysis techniques that attempt to discover and verify properties of the heap contents in (usually imperative) programs. The shape analysis problem becomes more challenging in concurrent programs that manipulate pointers and dynamically allocated objects, which are usually complicated. 
In concurrent programs, different threads interact in complex ways, which are difficult to foresee in the analysis. Several approaches for representing the possible structures of the heap have been proposed.
\input{heap-lazy-list}
 
TVLA (Three-Valued Logic Analysis) \cite{SagivRW02} is one of the first and one of the most popular shape analysis
methods. It is based on a three-valued first-order predicate logic with transitive closure. Intuitively, concrete heap structure is represented by a finite set of abstract summary cells, each of them representing a set of concrete cells. Summary cells are obtained by merging several heap cells that agree on the values of a chosen set of unary abstraction predicates.  %\bjcom{I think the explanation of summary cells should be improved to be understandable. You might consider putting a small illustration of what is a summary cell. }
A unique important aspect of TVLA is that it automatically generates the abstract transformers from the concrete semantics; these transformers are guaranteed to be sound, and precise enough to verify wide ranges of applications. However, it cannot fully automatically handle all programs, and that one may have to extend it by appropriate predicates etc. Its the synthesis of appropriate predicates that are able to express the invariants in the program. This problem is even more difficult with complicated heap structures such as skip-lists, trees, or arrays of lists.  

There are several other approaches
 based on the use of logics to present heap configurations. The logics can be separation logic \cite{John:SL, Stephen:SL,JoshCris:SL,Hongseok:SL,Kamil:SL,Chin:SL,Quang:SL, Ruzica:SL, Constrantin:SL}, monadic second-order
 % \bjcom{check how to separate or conjoin ``second'' ``order''}
 logic \cite{Ander:ML, Jakob:ML,Madhusudan:ML} and others \cite{Shmuel:Shape, Karen:Shape}. Among these works, the works based on separation logic are
 %such as \cite{JoshCris:SL,Hongseok:SL, Quang:SL} 
  more efficient than the others. 
  %\bjcom{The preceding sentence had no information. You can improve it} 
  The reason for that is that their approaches effectively decompose the heap into disjoint components and treat them independently. However, most of the techniques based on separation logic are either specialised for some particular data structure, or they need to be provided inductive definitions of the data structures. In addition, their entailment checking procedures are either for specific class of data structures or based on folding/unfolding inductive predicates in the formulae and trying to obtain a syntactic proof of the entailment. 

 
 This issue can be fixed addressed by automata-based techniques using the generality of the automata-based representation such as techniques using tree automata. Finite tree automata, for instance, have been shown to provide a good balance between efficiency and expressiveness. The work \cite{Ahmed:TreeAutomata} uses a finite tree automaton to describe a set of tree parts and represent non-tree edges of heaps by using regular “routing” expressions. Finite tree transducers
are used to compute set of reachable configurations, and symbolic configuration is abstracted
collapsing certain states of the automata. The refinement technique called counterexample-guided
abstraction refinement (CEGAR) technique is used during the run of the analysis. This technique
is fully automatically and can handle complex data structures such as binary trees with linked
leaves. However, it suffers from the inefficiency and it also can not handle concurrent programs.
%\bjcom{The preceding paragraph was interesting, but too hard to follow. Try to
%  explain in a more understandable way}

The problem of inefficiently of the previous technique can be solved by the approach based on forest automata \cite{foresterfull}. In such representation, a heap is split in a canonical way into several tree components whose roots are the so-called cut-points. Cut-points are cells which are pointed to by either program variables or having several incoming edges. The tree components can refer to the roots of each other, and hence they are “separated” much like heaps described by formulae joined by the separating conjunction in separation logic \cite{John:SL}. Using this decomposition, sets of heaps with a bounded number of cut-points can then be represented by so called forest automata (FA). Each of the tree
automata within the tuple accepts trees whose leaves may refer back to the
roots of any of these trees. A forest automaton then represents exactly the set
of heaps that may be obtained by taking a single tree from the language of each
of the component tree automata and by gluing the roots of the trees with the
leaves referring to them. %\bjcom{Previous sentences was a good explanation. Now
  %introduce the example, and discuss nested FAs only later}
 Moreover, they allow alphabets of FA to contain nested FA, leading to a hierarchical encoding of heaps, allowing us to represent even sets of heaps with an unbounded number of cut-points (e.g., sets of DLL, skiplist). \input FA
Let us take an example of how to split a heap into small tree components. Figure \ref{figure:forest} shows five tree components obtained by splitting the heap in figure \ref{lazy:list:heap:fig}. These components are named as 1,2,3,4 and 5 from left to right. Each root of a tree component is a cut-point in the heap in figure \ref{lazy:list:heap:fig}. These cut-points are cells pointed to by variables $\tt head$, $\tt tail$,  $\tt p$,  $\tt c$ and the cell which has two incoming pointers. In each tree component, the red node show which  tree component it refers. For instance, the tree component 1 refers to tree component 2, and both tree components 2 and 3 refer to tree component 4.

This forest automata approach is fully automatic and able to verify various classes of data structures, including complicated structures such as trees and skip-lists with bounded number of levels. 
However, the approach can not verify properties related to data values of heap cells such as sortedness in the lazy set algorithm. Therefore, in this thesis, we extend their work to verify data properties. 

The last approach that we will mention is based on graph grammars describing heap graphs \cite{Jonathan:Shape, Jonathan:Grammars}.  The approach is to model heap states hypergraphs, and represent both pointer operations and abstraction mappings by hypergraph transformations. The presented approaches differ in their degree of specialisation for a particular class of data structures, their efficiency, and their level of dependence on user assistance (such as definition of loop invariants or inductive predicates for the considered data structures).
  
\section*{Our Approaches}
In this thesis, we proposed three approaches for heap abstractions. In paper I, we proposed a novel approach of representing sets of heaps via tree automata (TA). In our representation, a heap is split in a canonical way into several tree components whose roots are the so-called cut-points. Cut-points are nodes pointed to by program variables or having several incoming edges. The tree components can refer to the roots of each other, and hence they are “separated” much like heaps described by formulae joined by the separating conjunction in separation logic [15]. Using this decomposition, sets of heaps with a bounded number of cut-points are then represented by the so called forest automata (FA) that are basically tuples of TA accepting tuples of trees whose leaves can refer back to the roots of the trees. Moreover, we allow alphabets of FA to contain nested FA, leading to a hierarchical encoding of heaps, allowing us to represent even sets of heaps with an unbounded number of cut-points (e.g., sets of DLL, skiplist). \input TA
In addition, we express relationships between data elements associated with nodes of the heap graph by two classes of constraints. Local data constraints are associated with transitions of TA and capture relationships between data of neighboring nodes in a heap graph; they can be used, e.g., to represent ordering internal to some structure such as a binary search tree. Global data constraints are associated with states of TA and capture relationships between data in distant parts of the heap. This approach was applied to verification of sequential heap manipulation programs. This approach is general and fully automatic, it can handle many types of sequential programs without any manual step. However, due to the complexity of tree automata operations, this approach is not suitable to handle concurrent programs where a large number of states and computation are needed. Figure \ref{figure:forest} shows an example of how to represent a heap by a set of tree automata. Figure \ref{figure:forest}(a) shows an example of a heap where nodes whose values are \nodea, \nodeb, \nodec, \noded, \nodee \; are cut-points, and $\tt x$, $\tt y$, $\tt z$ are local pointer variables and $\tt g$ is global pointer variable. Figure \ref{figure:forest}(b) shows its forest representation. In the forest representation, there are five TAs in which the TAs \taa \; and \tac \; refer to the root of the last TA \tae\;, and both TAs \tab \; and \tad \; refer to the root of TA \tac \;. The local data constraints are located along the solid arrows between nodes, whereas global constraints are located along the dashed arrows. In this figure, the global constraints $\tt \prec_{aa}$ means that all nodes in the left hand side are smaller than all nodes in the right hand side. We just show here small examples of data constraints, the detail about different types of constraints can be found in paper I.   

In paper II, we provide a symbolic encoding of the heap structure, that is less precise than the approach in paper I. However it is precise enough to allow the verification of the concurrent algorithms, and efficient enough to make the verification procedure feasible in practice. The main idea of the abstraction is to have a more precise description of the parts of the heap that are visible (reachable) from global variables, and to make a succinct representation of the parts that are local to the threads. More concretely, we will extract a set of heap segments, where the end points of a segment is pointed to by a cut-point which is reachable from global variables. A cut-point in this approach is a reachable node from global variable, and pointed by a global variables or having more than two incoming pointers. For each segment, we will store a summary of the content of the heap along the segment. This summary consists of two parts, each part contains different pieces of information, including the values of the cell variables if they have finite values, and the ordering among them if they are integer variables. The first part summaries information between the end point and its predecessor, whereas the second part summaries information between the start point and the predecessor node. For each given program, the set of possible abstract shapes insight and hence the verification procedure is guaranteed to terminate. This approach is very efficient but it is not optimal for complicated concurrent data structures like trees, lists of lists or skiplists. Figure \ref{heapsummary} gives our summary abstraction of the heap in figure \ref{figure:forest}(a). In this approach, \nodea, \nodeb, \nodec, \nodee \; are cut-points. The node \noded \; is not a cut-point like the approach in paper I because its not reachable from the global variable $\tt g$. In each heap segment, the fist part is described by the white box, and the second part is described by the gray box.   
\input SL
In paper III, we present an approach which can handle concurrent programs implemented from simple to complex data structures. In our fragment abstraction, we represent the part of the heap that is accessible to a thread by a set of fragments. A fragment represents a pair of heap cells (accessible to $\thread$)
that are connected by a pointer field, under the applied data abstraction. The fragment contains both
(i) {\em local} information about the cell's fields and variables that
  point to it, as well as
(ii) {\em global} information, representing how
  each cell in the pair can reach to and be reached from
  (by following a chain of pointers) a small set of globally significant
  heap cells.
 A set of fragments represents the set of heap
structures in which each pair of pointer-connected nodes is represented by some
fragment in the set.
Put differently, a set of fragments describes the set of heaps that can be formed by
``piecing together'' pairs of pointer-connected nodes that are represented
by some fragment in the set. This ``piecing together'' must
be both locally consistent (appending only fragments that agree on their
common node), and globally consistent (respecting the global reachability
information).
\input fragment

Let us illustrate how pairs of heap nodes can be represented by fragments. Figure \ref{fragment} shows the set of fragments abstracted from the heap in \ref{figure:forest}(a). In each fragment, the ordering between two keys of two nodes is shown as a label on the arrow between two tags. Above each tag is pointer variables. The first brown row under each tag is $\tt reachfrom$ information, whereas the second green row is $\tt reachto$ information.
