This doctoral thesis considers the proving both safety properties, and linearization properties of
both sequential and concurrent heap manipulating programs.
Such programs induce an infinite-state space in several dimensions:
they %
(i) consist of an unbounded number of concurrent threads, %
(ii) use unbounded dynamically allocated memory, and %
(iii) the domain of data values is unbounded. %
(iv) consist of un unbounded number of pointers. 
In addition, the linearization points of some programs are not fixed. They are depended on the future executions of these programs. 
Our method is to define an abstract model of the program, and we employ approximation techniques to that ignore irrelevant information so that we can reduce the problem into a finite-state model. In fact, we use an over-approximation, such that the abstract model cover all the behaviors of the original system.  Our framework is the first that
can automatically verify concurrent data structure implementations that employ
singly linked lists, skiplists~\cite{Fomitchev:2004,ArtOfMpP,Sundell:2005},
as well as arrays of singly linked lists~\cite{ts-stack},
at the same time as handling an unbounded
number of concurrent threads, an unbounded domain of data values
(including timestamps), and an unbounded shared heap. To the best of our knowledge, these verification problems have been
considered challenging in the verification community and
could not be carried out automatically by other existing methods.
