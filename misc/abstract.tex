This doctoral thesis considers the automatic verification of
\emph{parameterized systems}, i.e.\ systems with an arbitrary number
of communicating components, such as mutual exclusion protocols, cache
coherence protocols or heap manipulating programs. %
%%
The components may be organized in various topologies such as words,
multisets, rings, or trees.
%
The task is to show correctness regardless of the size of the system
and we consider two methods to prove safety:
%%
(i) a backward reachability analysis, using the well-quasi ordered
framework and monotonic abstraction, and
%%
(ii) a forward analysis which only needs to inspect a small number of
components in order to show correctness of the whole system. The
latter relies on an abstraction function that views the system from
the perspective of a fixed number of components. The abstraction is
used during the verification procedure in order to dynamically detect
cut-off points beyond which the search of the state-space need not
continue.
% 
Our experimentation on a variety of benchmarks demonstrate that the
method is highly efficient and that it works well even for classes of
systems with undecidable property.
%%
It has been, for example, successfully applied to verify a
fine-grained model of Szymanski's mutual exclusion protocol.
%%
Finally, we applied the methods to solve the complex problem of
verifying highly concurrent data-structures, in a challenging setting:
We do not a priori bound the number of threads, the size of the
data-structure, the domain of the data to store nor do we require the
presence of a garbage collector.
%%
We successfully verified the concurrent Treiber's stack and
Michael\&Scott's queue, in the aforementioned setting.
%
To the best of our knowledge, these verification problems have been
considered challenging in the parameterized verification community and
could not be carried out automatically by other existing methods.
