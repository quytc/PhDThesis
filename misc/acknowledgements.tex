%FINALLY! It has been long and even tough at times, but I made it!
%%
%We all know that I would not be writing this section if Parosh had not
%been there. I hope he understands how grateful I am to count him as my
%supervisor. But let me save the best for last and
%%
%let me start by thanking everyone else who contributed to my journey
%that leads to this thesis. I must of course start with my favorite
%czech companion \lukas. \lukasshort\ is a great researcher with
%tremendous motivation and skills. He was patient to listen to my
%ideas, which we both know must first make their way through a thick
%layer of verbose ramblings. It is nevertheless a great pleasure to
%work with him.
%%
%I enjoyed extremely much working with \bengt, and I wish we had more
%projects in common. He made me quickly feel at ease and confident,
%even though I felt intimidated at first. This was really impressive to
%witness such a great mind at work.
%% 
%I would like to thank \noomene, \ahmed, Lisa Kaati, Mayank Saksena,
%Johan Deneux, Sven Sandberg during my early days as a PhD student and
%%
%lately \jonathan, Othmane Rezine, Faouzi Atig, Trinh Cong Quy, Carl
%Leonardsson, Jari Stenman, Yunyun Zhu and Muneeb Khan.
%%
%From outside the IT department of Uppsala University, I would like to
%mention Tomas Vojnar, Yu-Fang Chen and Giorgio Delzanno who showed me
%how research works in other universities and how lucky I was at
%Uppsala University with Parosh.
%%
%From Uppsala University, my deepest thank you goes to Ivan
%Christoff. Ivan seems to always %genuinely
%have our well-being at heart. It is a truly remarkable quality that
%leaves me with a profond gratitude. %
%I would like to thank Mats Daniels, Wang Yi, Joachim Parrow, Ulrika
%Jaresund, Ulrika Andersson, Mattias Wigberg, Karl Marklund, to always
%have the time to lend me a hand or a complicit hear. %
%%
%%Everybody else at the department that I meet from time to time %
%%
%A special note goes to my previous supervisors Bj√∂rn Victor and Erik
%Hagersten who introduced me to the PhD program.

%%
%I developed a special profile as a PhD student, since I was given the
%chance to be the main teacher of several courses. Thank you Mats for
%trusting me with it. This was way more fun and challenging than a
%teaching assistant position.
%%
%Along with teaching skills, I also had the opportunity to learn a lot
%culturally about Sweden. This is mainly due to my participation in
%local dance schools. First as a student (thank you Johanna Berglund to
%drag me into that world) and then as a teacher. Yes, you read it
%right, I am a dancing nerd.  So it is now time to mention everyone
%else who contributed to my special time in Sweden. This time is
%probably not over but I still want to thank them. So here I
%shoot.
%%
%In Uppsala, thank you Junior, Marina, Fabien, Chris, Sepideh, Paul,
%Camilla, Paola, Lilly, Lina, Carlos, Alexander~K, Patrick, Alexander~H,
%Alexander~Ki, Linda, Yuri, Lisa~K, Tanja, Anna~G, Lisa-Marie, Ronak,
%Sasha, Amanda, Annika, Becky, Eva, Carmen, Eva-Lena, Wendelin, Isabel,
%John, Maele, Maggie, Maria, Malou, Rebecca, Tim, Anna~C, Erik~I,
%Matilda, Tove, Mia, Erika and Chiqui.
%%
%Special thanks to my tennis partners Nadim and Sebastian.
%%
%In Stockholm, thank you Kristofer, Marina, Alexander, Adela, Mina,
%Andreas, Behnaz, Egle, Camilla~C, Eshtar, Hind, Jaime, Jennifer,
%Johanna~E, Lalla, Pascal, Tofik and everyone else that I will soon meet.
%%
%And of course, let's not forget Lisa and Liza.
%%
%So, finally, we come to the main acknowledgment. This thesis starts
%with Parosh on my side and I would like to finish that section
%with {\parosh}. This has not been easy and despite my stubbornness, he
%was willing to put efforts into helping me. He backed me up at
%difficult times and trusted me at some other times. He gave me a
%chance to travel, trusted me with conference presentations and showed
%me that I maybe know more than it looked like.
%%
%It is almost too good to be true. Thank you {\Parosh}.
