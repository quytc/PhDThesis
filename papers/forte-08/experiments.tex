\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:exp}

We have implemented a prototype tool in C++ and run it on several models
of protocol with tree-like topologies.
%
The experiments have been performed on a dual Opteron 2.8 GHz, with
8 GB of RAM memory and the results are reported in Table~\ref{tab:exp}.

For each example, we give the number of iterations performed by the
reachability algorithm, the largest number of constraints maintained
at the end of the execution, the time and total memory consumption.
%
Full details of the examples can be found in~\cite{it:2008-010}.
