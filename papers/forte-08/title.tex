\begin{abstract}
%
Several recent works have considered \emph{parameterized verification},
i.e.\ automatic verification of systems consisting of an arbitrary
number of finite-state processes organized in a \emph{linear array}.
%
The aim of this paper is to extend these works by giving a simple and
efficient method to prove safety properties for systems with
\emph{tree-like} architectures.
%
A process in the system is a finite-state automaton and a transition
is performed jointly by a process and its parent and children
processes.
%
The method derives an over-approximation of the induced transition
system, which allows the use of finite trees as symbolic
representations of infinite sets of configurations.
%
Compared to traditional methods for parameterized verification of
systems with tree topologies, our method does not require the
manipulation of tree transducers, hence its simplicity and efficiency.
%
We have implemented a prototype which works well on several nontrivial
tree-based protocols.
