\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conc}

We have presented a method for verification of tree parameterized systems
where the components are organized in  a tree.
%
We derive an over-approximation of the transition
relation which allows the use of symbolic reachability
analysis defined on upward closed sets of trees
(configurations).
%
This technique has been implemented and successfully tested on a number of
tree-based protocols.
%


It would be interesting to see if
one can extend our method to other classes of 
architectures such as unordered trees, DAGs, and more general classes of graphs.
%
In a similar manner to the case of words \cite{rmc:wo:transducers:infinite}
we intend  to consider tree systems where
the individual processes may contain unbounded variables.
%
This would allow to analyze algorithms for manipulation of heaps,
(balanced) binary trees, etc.
%
Finally, we intend to extend our framework to check for liveness
properties on tree-like architecture systems (as done for
words in \cite{AJNOS04}).
