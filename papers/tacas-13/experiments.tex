%
We have implemented a prototype in OCaml and used it 
to automatically establish the conformance of concurrent 
data-structures (including lock-free and lock-based
stacks, queues and priority queues)
to their operational specification (implying their linearizability).
%
Our analysis also implicitly checks for standard shape-related errors such
as null/undefined pointer dereferencing (taking into account the known dangling pointers'
dereferences \cite{Michael:2002}), double-free, or presence of
cycles.
%, as well a dereferencing of a freed cell
%
%The examples cover stacks, queues and priority queues, in a lock-based
%or a lock-free fashion. 
%

Some of the examples are verified in the absence of garbage
collection,
%
in particular, the lock-free versions of Treiber's
\cite{Treiber:stack} stack and Michael\&Scott's queue (see
Figure~\ref{fig:MS}).  We hereafter refer to them as Treiber's stack
and M\&S's queue, and garbage collection as GC.
%
The verification of these examples is extensively demanding as it
requires to correlate the possible states of the threads with high
precision.
%
We are not aware of any other method capable of verifying high level functionality of these benchmarks.
%
We ran the experiments on a 3.5~GHz processor with 8GB~memory. We
report, in Table~\ref{experiments:results}, the running times (in
seconds) and the final number of joined shape constraints generated
($|C|$, reduced by symmetry). 
%

In addition to establishing correctness of the original versions of
the benchmark programs, we also stressed our tool with few examples in
which we intentionally inserted bugs (cf. Table~\ref{experiments:bugs}).
%
As expected, the tool did not establish correctness of these erroneous
programs since the approach is sound.
%
For example, we tested whether stacks (resp. queues) implementations
can exhibit fifo (resp. lifo) traces,
%
we tested whether values can be lost (loss observer),
or memory errors can be triggered (memo observer accepts 
on memory errors made visible),
%
we moved linearization points to wrong positions,
%
and we tested a program which stores wrong values of inserted data. 
%
In all these cases, the analysis correctly reported traces that 
violated the concerned safety property.
%
Finally, we ran the data structure implementations without garbage
collection discarding the \code{age} counters and our (precise)
analysis produced as expected a trace involving the ABA problem \cite{aba:1983}.
%
%In this case, the analysis showed its precision 
%by reporting a safety violation after precisely recreating the ABA scenario.

%This is meant to observe the ABA problem~\ref{ABA}:
%
% A deleting thread working slowlyer than other inserting threads could
% not notice the modifications to the data-structure and loose in
% essence some inserted data.
%
%If two threads point to a cell that they are about to deallocate. One
%of them will succeed faster and a third thread might reallocate a new
%cell at that same location. The slowest thread might continue its
%execution without noticing the changes. It is therefore possible that
%this latter thread dequeues the cell without noticing that many others
%have been enqueued in the meantime. The loss observer does capture
%this faulty behavior.

% The examples can be described with a simple C-like programming
% language and can be found in Appendix~\ref{appendix:experiments}.

We also include a succinct comparison with related work. Although it is
often unfair to compare approaches solely based on running times of
different tools, we believe that such a comparison can give an idea of
the efficiency of the involved approaches.
%
%To support the claim that our method is of a superior efficiency, 
%We cite in the following some published running times of other tools.
Our running times on the versions of Treiber's stack and M\&S's queue
that assume GC are comparable with the results of
\cite{Vafeiadis:RGSep}. However, the verification of versions that do
not assume GC is, to the best of our knowledge, beyond the reach of
\cite{Vafeiadis:RGSep} (since it does not correlate states of different threads). 
%
\cite{Sagiv:correlation} verifies linearizability of concurrent
implementations of sets,  e.g., a lock-free \code{CAS}-based set
\cite{Vechev:PLDI08} (verified in 2975s) of a comparable complexity to
M\&S's queue without GC (550s with our prototype).
%
Basic memory safety of M\&S's queue and two-locks
queue~\cite{MS:QueueAlgorithms} without GC was also verified in
\cite{YaSa:queue}, but only for a scenario where all threads are
either dequeuing or enqueuing. The verification took 727s and 309s for
M\&S's queue and 6162s and 304s for the two-locks queue. Our
verification analysis produced the same result significantly faster,
even allowing any thread to non deterministically decide to either
enqueue or dequeue.
%
In \cite{BLMRS:cav08}, linearizability of the Treibers's stack (resp.\
two-locks queue~\cite{MS:QueueAlgorithms}) is verified in 53s (resp.\
47s). We achieve the same result in less than 3 seconds. 
Finally, a variant of M\&S's queue without GC could not be %successfully
verified in \cite{BLMRS:cav08} 
due to lack of memory.
