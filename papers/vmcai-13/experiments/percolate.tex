This protocol simulates the way results propagate in a digital
circuit. At the leaves lie a serie of binary inputs. The nodes of the
tree act as boolean {\tt OR} gates.

 At first, every gate has its
output set to \emph{unknown}. At each step of the protocol, a gate for
which each input is determined can set its output to a definite
value. The process iterates until the root gate has a definite value.
