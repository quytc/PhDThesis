\Section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

We have presented a method to model-check race-freeness of programs
written in a subset of the C language, using POSIX threads. We model
the behaviour of the system as Petri nets and take advantage of upward
closure to efficiently represent infinite sets of
configurations. Race-freeness is a safety property and we check it
using a symbolic backward reachability analysis. It is based on a
simple algorithmic principle and is fully automatic and sound. It is
moreover guaranteed to terminate for the class of properties we
consider.
%

We plan to extend the model to obtain a closer relationship to
pthreaded programs. For instance, we will include waiting for
termination of a specific thread and broadcasting of a wake up
signal. We also would like to measure the usefulness of the method by
examining the amount of false positives and the limitations with
respect to the program size. Finally, we would like to report more
precise program traces involving race conditions.
