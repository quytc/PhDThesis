A barrier is a tool to ensure synchronization between threads and
allows a programmer to impose restriction for an asynchronous
multi-threaded program.
%
A process arriving at the barrier must stop at this point and cannot
proceed until all other processes reach this barrier.

The following model represents a barrier with a \emph{pivot}. The
first thread at the barrier will take the role of a pivot and all
other processes wait as long as there is a pivot. When all processes
have arrived at the barrier, the pivot can then proceed, which in turn
releases all the waiting processes.

A process can be in state \emph{before} (B), \emph{wait} (W),
\emph{pivot} (P) or \emph{after} (A). %
%
Initially, all processes are in state B and a bad configuration is
detected when there is a process in state A, while there is still a
process in state B.

The transition diagram and inhibitor net are as follows.

The following invariant can be derived: %
(i) a pivot~$P$ can coexist with a process in state~$B$ and/or $W$, or
is alone, i.e.\ the set of configurations $\set{P\wedge B^* \wedge
  W^*}$, %
(ii) a process after the barrier can only coexist with other process
after the barrier or still waiting, i.e.\ the set of configurations
$\set{W^* \wedge A^+}$, %
and (iii) initially, all processes were before the barrier, i.e.\
$\set{B^*}$.

It is also possible to model it with a linear topology as in
Section~\ref{section:introduction}~and~\ref{section:paramsys}. %
In that case, we can consider a non-atomic version, which would not
check the state of the other processes all at once.

A typically implementation uses an atomic counter as follows.
