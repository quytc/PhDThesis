\begin{abstract}
We present a method for automatic verification of systems with a
parameterized number of communicating processes, such as mutual
exclusion protocols or agreement protocols. %
The method handles non well quasi-ordered systems and allows to derive
invariants which are not upward-closed. %
In particular, it allows to model fine-grained global transitions, that
is, other processes are not inspected atomically by a given process.
% 
We show experimentally the efficiency of the method, on various
examples, including a fine-grained model of Szymanski's mutual
exclusion protocol which, to the best of our knowledge, cannot be done
automatically by other existing methods.
