  We propose a new approach for automatic verification of programs
  with dynamic heap manipulation. The method is based on symbolic
  (backward) reachability analysis using upward-closed sets of heaps
  w.r.t. an appropriate preorder on graphs. These sets are represented
  by a finite set of minimal graph patterns corresponding to a set of
  bad configurations. We define an abstract semantics for the programs
  which is monotonic w.r.t. the preorder. Moreover, we prove that our
  analysis always terminates by showing that the preorder is a
  well-quasi ordering. Our results are presented for the case of
  programs with 1-next selector. We provide experimental results
  showing the effectiveness of our approach.
