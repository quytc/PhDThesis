%\paragraph{Outline.}
\bigskip%
%
We first describe the domain of formal verification, where this thesis
belongs, and approach the problem in a top down fashion.

%
We present two techniques in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:monotonic:abstraction}~and~\ref{chapter:view:abstraction}
to prove safety properties for a wide range of programs (listed in
Chapter~\ref{chapter:case:studies}).
%
Finally, we dedicate Chapter~\ref{chapter:shape:analysis} to the
problem of shape analysis. It deals with a class of programs that
manipulate memory heaps concurrently.
%
To finish, we give some conclusions and potential directions for
future research topics.
