%In this chapter, we consider a difficult challenge \index{Challenge}
%in software verification, namely to automate its application to
%algorithms with an unbounded number of threads that concurrently
%access a~dynamically allocated shared heap.
%\index{Heap Analysis}%
%%
%Such algorithms are notoriously difficult to get correct and verify,
%since they often employ fine-grained synchronization and avoid locking
%wherever possible.
%%
%This chapter presents an efficient technique to verify that
%a~concurrent implementation of a~common data type abstraction, such as
%a~queue or a~stack, conforms to a~simple abstract specification of its
%(sequential) functionality.
%%
%There are several combined challenges to be addressed.
%%
%\begin{challenges}
%\item \label{unbounded:data:domain:specification}%
%  \index{Challenge}%
%  \index{Infinite-state}%
%  The abstract specification is infinite-state, because the
%  implemented data structure may contain an unbounded number of data
%  values from an infinite domain.
%\item The program is infinite-state in several dimensions:
%  \index{Challenge}%
%  \index{Unbounded}%
%  \begin{subchallenges}
%  \item \label{unbounded:threads}%
%    it consists of an unbounded number of concurrent threads,
%  \item \label{unbounded:heap:size}%
%    it uses unbounded dynamically allocated memory, and
%  \item \label{unbounded:data:domain}%
%    the domain of data values is unbounded.
%  \end{subchallenges}
%\item \label{no:garbage:collection}%
%  \index{Challenge}%
%  \index{Non Garbage-Collection}%
%  The program does not rely on automatic garbage collection.\\%
%  It manages memory explicitly.
%\end{challenges}

%%% -------------------------------------------
%We present, in the first section of this chapter, the type of programs
%we consider. In the following sections, we introduce in a stepwise
%manner how we cope with each of the above challenges. In the last
%section, we combine the different techniques and present the
%verification method.

%%All in a succint manner.
