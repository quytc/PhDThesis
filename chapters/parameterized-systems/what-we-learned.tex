\item[Parameterized systems] are infinite-state and the focus of this
  thesis. They are formally defined as a pair $\parsys=(\locs,\rules)$
  where \locs\ is a finite set of process states and \rules\ is a set
  of local or global transitions over \locs .
\item[Induced Model.] The system \parsys\ induces an infinite-state
  model $(\confs,\trans)$ which describes the configurations \confs\
  and how to update from a~configuration to another using the
  transition relation~{\trans}.
\item[Reachability problem] is now formally defined using the induced
  model, the set bad configurations \Bad\ and the set of initial
  configurations \Inits .
  %
  % If the bad configurations are unreachable from the initial
  % configurations, the abstract system is then proven safe and by
  % construction of the over-approximation, so is the original system.
\item[Features.] Parameterized systems can be designed with several
  features in mind, especially regarding the topology and the type of
  communication allowed between processes.
  % These make the parameterized verification a challenging problem.
