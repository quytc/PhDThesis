Computers have been used for variety of applications in business, science, education, engineering and so on. They help to solve real world problems that would otherwise be slow, impossible or extremely difficult to address without computers and software. However, sometimes they do not behave exactly as we expect them to do. In some cases, the consequence could be very serious for errors in banking systems
and flight control systems. Errors in computer systems are mostly not caused by the machine itself, but typically originate from the software that controls the computer systems, so called bugs.

Bugs are quite common in complex software systems,
since they typically have complicated input and involve many features which makes them difficult to design and make them perfect by human effort.

Detecting and fixing software bugs are important tasks in software development process. Remaining undetected bugs in any software project may lead huge
problems. They can be very hard to detect and correct. It will
become too costly to solve. Therefore, it is very important to allocate sufficient
resources, both in terms of time and manpower, to ensuring that developed
software is as free of bugs as possible.

Some bugs are less serious than others. In some cases, we can still use software programs with these bugs. For example, bugs appearing in computer games and online news. However, in the case of critical systems 
%such as banking, software systems in airplanes, safety is the most important aspect and we have to ensure that there no bugs in either the software nor the hardware.
especially algorithms in libraries of programming languages, safety is the most important aspect and we have to ensure that there no bugs. These algorithms are used in many applications, and bugs will have wide impacts. Some of such libraries provide standard data structures such as stacks, queues, containers. These data structures provide ways of storing multiple values in a single variable.

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and operations that can be applied to the data. 
%Each data structure has it own specification which describes the behaviour of the data structure. 
A data structure can be both sequential or concurrent, concurrent data structures can be accessed and manipulated concurrently by many parallel threads are a central component of many parallel software applications. 
%They should allow a large degree of parallelism among accessing threads to minimize serialization bottlenecks, while maintaining the appearance of atomic operations. 
Data structures typically use heap-allocated memory to store their data. For example, concurrent link queue in java.util.concurrent uses singly linked list data structure to store data.   


%Many modern programming languages provide libraries of concurrent data structures (e.g., the java.util.concurrent package and Intel Threading Building Blocks library) that are widely used. 



The predominant method to improve software quality is
\emph{testing}. It is a dynamic analysis where a program is run under specific conditions, so-called test cases, and checking
whether the result with a given input matches the expected output.
%
The test cases are carefully designed to cover all possible cases of program executions.\index{Coverage}

%Similarly, we can check for correctness of a program by using a \emph{model} of the program. The model can be extracted by
%removing all parts that are irrelevant for the tests, and can be used
%to \emph{simulate} the executions. 
However, there is no guarantee to cover all possible executions. Therefore, we have to find the way to achieve a full coverage of program executions. Therefore, \emph{testing} can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence. So, it is needed to use formal verification that a software system is correct with respect to some specifications. %

% The topic of this thesis is centered around the following question.
% %
% \begin{statement}
%   \it%
%   Can we design a method that would give us\\%
%   \emph{guarantees} that no error is left undetected\\%
%   and that does not (too much) suffer from state-space explosion?
% \end{statement}
