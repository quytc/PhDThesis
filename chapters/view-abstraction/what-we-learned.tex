\begin{description}
\item[A solution to the reachability problem] from
  Section~\ref{section:reachability:problem}.
\item[Abstraction and Concretization] functions define how to travel
  between sets of views and sets of configurations. An important
  notion to retain is that views work collectively to characterize
  configurations.
\item[Verfication Procedure] is composed of two nested loops, one of
  which is a~simple fixpoint. The other loop searches for a~cut-off
  point.
\item[Soundness.] The method computes an invariant that covers the
  reachable configurations of any size, using views of small sizes.
\item[Completeness.] The method is complete for WQO and for almost
  downward-closed invariants.
\item[Approximation] is introduced in order to leverage the
  entailement on views and makes it easier to compute.
\item[Acceleration] is achieved by seeding the fixpoint computation with more views.
\item[Requirements.] The procedure requires to be able to compute the
  initial views, test for the characterization of bad configurations
  (using the upward-closedness of the set of bad configurations nad
  checking for the presence of some ``bad'' views).
\item[Efficiency.] The method has proven to be very efficient as shown
  in the results (see Paper~\ref{paper:VMCAI13}
  and~\ref{paper:SAS14}). It exhibits the small model properties,
  i.e.\ most patterns occur in small instances.
